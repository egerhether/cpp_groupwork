Redirection

> redicrecting: this command in the terminal allows for saving the output of
a program stated before the ">" symbol to a file after the symbol, for example
"program > output.txt"

< redictecting: this command in th terminal makes it so the program specified
after the symbol is used as an input to the program or command before the "<",
for example "program < input.txt"

Piping

Piping allows for running multiple commands or programs in succession with
the output of the preceding command or program being the input of the one 
after it. So with "program1 | program2" we get to run program1 first,
its output will be redirected to the input of program 2 which then will be 
run with that input.
