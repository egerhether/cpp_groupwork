We are not able to use R"(...)" whenever inside our string we want to output
there is either a "( or a )" as it will close the raw string literal. In this
case we need to use a marker such as delimiter in order to open and close our
raw string literal.
(note: the marker must also not appear in the stringin this form: "delimiter(
or )delimiter" for the same reason as above)
