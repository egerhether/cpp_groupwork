Why does the program break after introducing d_text?

Introducing d_text to the class while keeping the old main.o file
directly affects the layout of the memory which in turn affects Application Binary Interface. 


Why doesn't the program break anymore when using a pointer to the implementation?

When you use a Pimpl design, change to the implementation of the class does not affect the ABI.
This means the program will run as expected.

If I have a correctly designed class but need to add data members while not using the pimpl approach,
adding them to the end of the class should actually be ok as the memory layout stays the same.
It could also be useful to make the data members private in the class which helps with ABI stability.
