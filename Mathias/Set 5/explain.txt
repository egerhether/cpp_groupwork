1. What differences exist between pointer variables and arrays?

Pointers store addresses to specific locations in the memory, but arrays just store a collection of different elements.
The array size is also determined during declaration, but pointers can point to different places dynamically. Pointers also need to be dereferenced before the "content" can be accessed.
Arrays can decay into pointers to their first elements when passed into functions for example.

2. What differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables?

Reference variables are aliases to existing objects and cannot be reseated.
Pointers use the * operator to access the value they point to, while references use the . or -> operator to access the value directly.

4. What is pointer arithmetic?
Pointer arithmetic basically involves doing arithmetic on pointers, like addition or substraction. For example, if you have an int *ptr to an array, incrementing by one moves the pointer to the next element. This allows us to traverse arrays and other data structures.
