An implementation of the class named "Numbers" capable of storing a fixed number of integers,
with an option to initialize or instead leave them uninitialized. It also supports inspecting
and modifying stored ints using the "at" function and provides the ability to write values to an ostream
with the "write" functio. It can also report the number of stored integers with the "length" function. 

In testing, we indeed see that the program works from the output:
47 47 99

However, when we try to print out the uninitialized ints, we see random values:
0 123 0
