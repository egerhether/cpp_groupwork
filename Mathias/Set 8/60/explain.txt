The class demo has different constructors and assignment operators.
There's also a factory function that creates Demo objects and prints messages.
The main function shows how these constructors and operators work, including copy and move operation.
There is also a demonstartion of how copy elision happens during a function call: fun(factory());
In this case, the compiler recognizes that the temporary Demo object that factory() creates can be directly constructed
as the argument for the fun.
