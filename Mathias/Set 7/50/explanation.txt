Ofstream and fstream deal differently with the data.
Namely, ofstream automatically creates the file if it does not exist yet.
This is why "hello world" is written there without any problems. However, 
when using fstream and if "/tmp/out2" doesn't exist, it also does not create the
file by itself. And if there is no file, "hello world" never gets written.

We can use the open function with appropriate flags. The out creates the file if it does not already exist.
The other option is to use ofstream instead of fstream, which is usually more appropriate if we 
want to write data to files.

fstream out2;
out2.open("/tmp/out2", ios::out);
hello(out2);
