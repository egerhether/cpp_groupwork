We can conclude from the test that using the out.good() if statement is really useful in
reducing the total run time.

Version without the out.good() check:
./a.out 100000000
Execution time: 3.74387 seconds

Version with the out.good() check:
./a.out 100000000                    
Execution time: 0.465495 seconds

The if statement prevents unnecessary output operations when out's failbit is set.
