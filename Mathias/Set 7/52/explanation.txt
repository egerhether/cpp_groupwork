istringstreams allow us to read data from a string as it was coming from an input source. 
In order for the program to function correctly, we need to create a separate istringstream for
each of the arguments. Otherwise, it continues from where it left off during the first argument.

At the moment, the same istringstream is used for both. Therefore,
we should create a separate one just for the second argument:

             // first argument istringstream
istringstream istr1(argv[1]);
    size_t no1 = 0;
    istr >> no1;

            // second argument istringstream
istringstream istr2(argv[2]);
    size_t no2 = 0;
    istr >> no2;
