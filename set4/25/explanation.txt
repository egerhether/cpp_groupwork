1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a process of grouping data and functions together, usually in
a class such that functions only operate on variables within the same class.
This allows for impoved readability and security as firstly, only objects of 
that class can call the function and thus we are conceiving complexity of our
program from the outside as well as it allows for convenient grouping of
related data and functions. 

class word
{
    char d_firstLetter;

    public:
        void showFirstLetter();

        void setFirstLetter(char letter);
};

Here we see we were able to group related function and variable together and 
furthermore the variable itself is not accessible directly outside of the 
class, it can only be used by the functions within.

2. Data hiding

Data hiding is a process for which we use encapsulation. Its goal is to
protect sensitive data from being accessed in ways not specified when
programming as well as prevent them from being modified. It is very important
for security of the data handling that can be done by the programme.

class bankAcc
{
    int d_balance;
    bool verifyValid(int transaction);

    public:
    
        void changeBalance(int transaction); // function calling verifyValid
};

In this example we see that balance is not directly accessible as well as the 
method of checking if transction is valid which allows for improved security.
We only allow to change balance if the transaction is valid but we don't
reveal how we check it.


Class implementation is irrelevant to this exercise as we don't need to see
implementation in order to determine if encapsulation or data hiding was used.
We can see these concepts straight from the class structure.
