Check compilation times when not using using precompiled headers

For compiling without precompiled headers I used the default settings of
icmconf then icmbuild. For compilation with precompiled headers I removed "//"
preding #define IH and #define PRECOMP in the icmconf file then icmbuild.
Obviously I ran icmbuild clean in between those steps.

No precompiled headers:
real    0m9,451s
user    0m8,348s
sys     0m0,936s

With precompiled headers:
real    0m8,527s
user    0m7,253s
sys     0m1,091s

We see that with precompiled headers the compilation time is about a second 
faster. This increase in efficiency would be even more apparent if the project 
was bigger and contained more than one class.
