1. declare a variable ptr pointing to rows of 8 doubles

double (*ptr)[8];

2. declare a variable ptr pointing to an array holding the addresses of series 
of doubles. The series of doubles may consist of different numbers of doubles 

double **ptr;

3. declare a pointer ptr that may point to arrays of immutable pointers to 
arrays of mutable pointers to immutable std::string objects. 

const std::string ***ptr;

4. declare a function fun expecting no parameters, returning a matrix of 6 x 6 
std::string objects 

std::string (*fun())[6]

5. Declare a function fun as in the previous item, now using StringMat

StringMat fun();

6. complete the following function by providing the initialization section of 
its for-statement (submit the completed function):


    void process(unsigned begin, unsigned end, char const *const *args)
    {
        for (char const *const *argsBegin = &args[begin], 
                *argsEnd = &args[end]; argsBegin != argsEnd; ++argsBegin)
            process(*argsBegin);
    }
        
7. declare a function fun defining a parameter ptr which is an immutable 
pointer to NTBSs, returning one of these pointers as an immutable NTBS 

const char *fun(const char *const *ptr);
