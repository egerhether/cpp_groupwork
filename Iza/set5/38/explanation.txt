Check for flaw in the design of Phonebook programme.

When compiling main.cc before the finder.cc in the main repository no phone
numbers will be retrieved as the static Finder s_finder object member of the
PhoneBook class is not initiased. Hence the get function that calls it to
obtain phone numbers doesn't perform its function and returns a null pointer.

This can be fixed by not initialising s_finder on compilation and rather
including a getFinder() function in the phonebook class which will initialise
s_finder only after the user wants to access the data.

static Finder &getFinder()
{
    static Finder s_finder;         // initialized on first access
    return s_finder;
}
