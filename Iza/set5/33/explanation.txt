1. differences between pointer variable and arrays

Pointer variables are dynamic and their memory is allocated at runtime in
contrast to arrays which are static and their memory is allocated at compile
time. Pointer variables store addresses of a single variable while arrays 
stores multiple of the same data type.

2. differences between pointer variables and reference variables

Pointers with the same name can be re-assigned to point to another value, 
while references can't be changed to reference another value after 
initializing. To access value pointed to by a pointer one needs to dereference
it first while it's correct to just use the name of the reference variable. 
The pointer can point to NULL while there cannot be a NULL reference and while
we can perform arithmetic operations on pointers we can't do it on references.

4. what is meant by pointer arithmetic

Poiter arithmetic is a set of arithmetic operations we can perform on pointer,
they include incrementing/decrementing (++, --), comparison (<, ==), 
subtracting two pointers pointing to the same type from each other and adding
and subtracting an integer from the pointer.
