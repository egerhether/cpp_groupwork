Fix fstream object to create a file

fstream out2{ "/tmp/out2" };
hello(out2);

doesn't create the file out2 as fstream object by itself is neither an input
nor an output stream hence inserting "hello world\n" in the hello function
doesn't output or input the NTBS, it just inserts the NTBS into the stream.

To fix it we can make the following ammend to the code.
