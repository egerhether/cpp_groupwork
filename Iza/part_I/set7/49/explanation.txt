Preventing output from being written

For the first version of the program (without the if-statement) running 

>time ./tmp/bin/binary 100000000

gives

real    0m8,115s
user    0m8,077s
sys     0m0,015s

and for the other version 

real    0m0,112s
user    0m0,102s
sys     0m0,005s

the second version is significantly faster as the checking operation of whether
the ostream out is in failed state or not is quicker than the program trying 
and failing to perform the stream. This is due the first program repeatedly 
calls the insertion operator.
