Learn to understand behaviours of istringstream

The outputs are not 
extracted first number: 1
extracted second number: 2

but 
extracted first number: 1
extracted second number: 0

as we re-initialise the istr object but we do not clear the stream meaning that
the extraction to no2 is empty. It is empty because argv[1] and argv[2]
contains no spaces so 2nd position is empty. Thus we only cout the no2 which was
initialised to 0.


to fix it we can do
cout << "extracted first number: " << no1 << '\n';

istr.clear();
istr.str(argv[2]);
