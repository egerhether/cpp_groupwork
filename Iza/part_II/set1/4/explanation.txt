1. the code in its initial state doesn't compile because the boolean conversion
operator is explicit, so while the if statement calls it directly allowing for
getting the truth value out of getline, our function doesn't do it directly.
Thus due to the getPrompt function attempting to do implicit boolean conversion
it tries to return an std::basic_istream object instead of bool which is 
stated in the return type.


2. bool promptGet(istream &in, string &str)
{
    cout << "Enter a line or ^D\n";
    return bool(getline(in, str));
};


3. istream &promptGet(istream &in, string &str)
{
    cout << "Enter a line or ^D\n";
    return getline(in, str);
};
