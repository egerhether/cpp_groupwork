Fix a problem in the strings class

1. Why are there two "at" functions declared?

One of them deals with constant and non-constant elements separately,
the constant one gives access to but doesn't allow for modifications
while the non-constant one allows for modifications.

2. Which one is used in the abovementioned main function? 

The const one as we are only couting the string.

3. Provide example showing a situation where the other at member is used. 

Strings obj;
obj.add("string");

obj.at(0) = "modified string"; 

DEFECT: the defect in the provided code is that the defined class strings 
doesn't contain a destructor.
