Implement a program in which

x - an array of 5 Person objects is defined (note: changing the size must 
only require you to change the number of elements of the array). Also, this 
array may not be a global array;

x - a function is called reading all of the Persons' data from the standard 
input stream, showing a '? ' prompt just before reading the next line.

x - a function is called writing the data of all the Persons' data to the 
standard output stream.
