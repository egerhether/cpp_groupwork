add move functionality to the Strings class

for copying the time for the output usually took:
real    0m0,008s
user    0m0,002s
sys     0m0,006s

while for moving the result was a big quicker:
real    0m0,007s
user    0m0,003s
sys     0m0,004s

not a big difference in time can probably be explained by the environ variable 
only allowing for 84 iterations.
